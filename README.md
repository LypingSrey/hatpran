# HatPran

[![CI](https://github.com/LypingSrey/hatpran/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LypingSrey/hatpran/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A workout tracker for iPhone, Android and the web. Log your sets as you train, save routines as templates, and let
HatPran keep your personal records up to date automatically.

## Features

- **Log workouts:** start from scratch or from a template, tick sets off as you go, and see a live timer, volume
  and set count. Sets can be normal, warmup, drop or failure, and each exercise type asks for the right numbers
  (weight and reps, reps only, duration, distance and so on).
- **Templates:** save a routine once and start it again with one tap. HatPran tracks how often you use each one.
- **Exercise library:** 74 built-in exercises across 17 muscle groups and 20 kinds of equipment, plus your own
  custom exercises.
- **Automatic personal records:** heaviest weight, most reps, best set volume, longest duration and longest
  distance, per exercise. Finishing a workout celebrates any new records. Editing or deleting a past set rebuilds
  them, and warmups and unticked sets never count.
- **Past records:** add bests you set before using the app. A logged set that beats one takes over as the record.
- **Profile:** a profile picture, lifetime stats, your latest workouts and records, and editing for your name,
  email and password.
- **Edit your history:** change a finished workout's name, notes, date, start time, duration or sets.

## Tech stack

| Folder | What | Stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`backend/`](backend) | REST API | PHP 8.3+, Laravel 13, Sanctum token auth, PostgreSQL 17 |
| [`frontend/`](frontend) | Mobile + web app | React Native 0.86, Expo SDK 57, Expo Router, TypeScript |

## Getting started

You need PHP 8.3+, Composer, Docker (for PostgreSQL) and Node.js.

**1. Start the API**

```bash
cd backend
composer install
cp .env.example .env && php artisan key:generate
# set DB_PASSWORD in .env to any value, then start PostgreSQL (data persists in a Docker volume):
docker compose up -d --wait
php artisan migrate --seed
php artisan storage:link      # serves uploaded profile pictures
php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

Seeding loads the exercise library and a local test account, `test@example.com` with password `password`.

The development database is PostgreSQL 17 on `127.0.0.1:54320` (database and user `hatpran`, password from
`.env`), so any SQL client can connect with `postgresql://hatpran:<DB_PASSWORD>@127.0.0.1:54320/hatpran`.

**2. Start the app**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npx expo start   # i = iOS simulator, a = Android emulator, w = web, or scan the QR code with Expo Go
```

On a phone, the app automatically talks to the API on the Mac serving the Expo bundle. See
[`frontend/README.md`](frontend/README.md) for pointing it at another server.

## Tests and checks

The API tests run against a separate, throwaway PostgreSQL container on port 54329, so they never touch your
development data:

```bash
cd backend
docker compose -f compose.testing.yaml up -d --wait
php artisan test
```

For the app:

```bash
cd frontend
npx tsc --noEmit   # typecheck
npx expo lint      # lint
```

GitHub Actions runs all of these on every push ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)).
