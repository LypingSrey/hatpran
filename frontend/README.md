# HatPran app

The React Native app for HatPran (Expo SDK 57 + Expo Router). It runs on iOS, Android and the web, and talks to
the Laravel API in [`../backend`](../backend).

## Run it

1. Start the API from `../backend`, listening on all interfaces so phones and emulators can reach it:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
   ```

2. Start the app from this folder:

   ```bash
   npm install        # first time only
   npx expo start
   ```

   Then press `i` (iOS simulator), `a` (Android emulator) or `w` (web), or scan the QR code with Expo Go.

## Pointing at the API

On a phone running Expo Go, the app automatically calls the API on the same Mac that serves the
Expo bundle (`http://<mac-ip>:8000/api`), so the Laravel server must be started with `--host=0.0.0.0`.
The iOS simulator and web use `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`; the Android emulator uses `http://10.0.2.2:8000/api`.

To force a specific server, set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.1.20:8000/api npx expo start
```

The login and Profile screens show which server the app is using.

## Checks

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit   # typecheck
npx expo lint      # lint
```

## Structure

- `src/app/`: screens, using Expo Router's file-based routes.
  - `(tabs)/`: the five tabs, Workouts, Templates, Exercises, Records and Profile.
  - `workout/`, `template/`, `exercise/`: detail and create screens. `workout/edit/` edits a finished workout.
  - `profile/edit`: profile picture, name, email and password.
  - `record/manual`: add, edit or delete a record entered by hand.
- `src/lib/`: the API client (`api.ts`), session handling (`auth.tsx`; the token lives in SecureStore, or
  localStorage on the web), types, formatting, dialogs and the profile picture picker.
- `src/components/`: shared UI (`ui.tsx`), the set-logging row, the exercise picker, and the workout, record,
  avatar and date components.
